title: Prevent Wheel Reinvention 
curator: Reika Chavers

summary: learn to curate like a boss in Unacademic

description: | 
  How many wheels have you had to reinvent already? Our guess would be ‘too 
  many’. Somehow, we keep creating new textbooks and courses, but most 
  information is out there already. You just need a set up that organizes the 
  information in one place, with just the right amount of structure. You 
  don’t want to be told what to learn, but you don’t want to have to figure 
  out everything yourself either. So gather those interesting blog posts, 
  podcasts, or tutorials, add your comments, and share them. That’s it!

  - title: Structure the Logic
    description: | 
      Every story needs a structure. Think of a waypoints as a narrative 
      with an introduction a body and a conclusion. Remember that to pass on 
      knowledge you need to contextualize and structure for better 
      understanding. Also people tend to be more motivated in their learning 
      when its a story. First start with structuring the story you want to 
      transfer into checkpoints.

  - title: Explain the Relevance
    description: |

      highlight certain critical aspects of the reference.
