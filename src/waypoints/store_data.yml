title: Store and Retrieve Data

summary: Learn how to deal with locally and remotely persisted data.

  By default, JavaScript programs store their data in memory. This is fine as
  long as you keep your browser tab open and do not need to share information
  with others. Things become much more interesting, however, when we start
  persisting and retrieving data.

  description: |
    Over the last few years, web browsers have turned into complete operation
    systems. One of the core tasks of any OS is to persist and retrieve data. The
    browser’s version of the harddrive is called *local storage*, and is now
    consistently implemented in all the major browsers.

    Local Storage is a so-called ‘key-value store’, which is a difficult way of
    saying that it’s one big javascript object, in this case augmented with
    some convenience methods.
  instructions:
    - Try LocalStorage out in the developer console in your browser.

- title: String it Together
  description: |
    All the keys and values in local storage are simply strings. This works
    great, as long as we want to store texts. As soon as we want to persist other
    types of data, however, we first need to convert them to strings. This process
    is known under many different names: serialization, stringification, marshalling.

    The opposite of serialization is most often called parsing. It consists of
    translating a string back to a data structure.
  instructions:

      Build a basic parser that translates our session documents to JavaScript objects.
      Included in the plunker are the expectations that your code needs to fulfill, as
      well as more detailed instructions.
