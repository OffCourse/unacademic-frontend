summary: Learn to navigate through Offcourse

description: |
  Do you have a hard time finding your way through the interface? We have minimised the interface design so that you can keep your focus on learning and curating. The core functionalities are limited to the ones you need: mode button, toolbar and the card stack. That's all!

  - title: Switch Cognitive Modes
    introduction: |
      You learn most effectively when you explain what you've learnt to someone else. Changing your perspective makes your learning more active. Switch between cognitive modes (learning & curating) on Offcourse by clicking the logo in the left upper corner.

    instructions:
      - Have a look at the resources for in depth understanding and explore switching modes by clicking the Offcourse logo in the left upper corner
