  - title: Tool the bar
    introduction: |
      To keep all the important information in the same place, the toolbar is your anchorpoint. The toolbar shows you where you are in the interface. For instance when you start learning a waypoint, the waypoint moves to the toolbar and all the checkpoint are visible on the right.
